## Introduction


I analyzed customer churn to provide Databel's management with insights into their retention rate. This analysis highlighted patterns and factors contributing to customer turnover, enabling data-driven strategies to improve retention

## Problem statement

The analysis aimed to provide insights into the following business questions:

1. What is the current churn rate, and how does it vary by account length and type?
2. What are the top reasons for customer churn?
3. How do subscriber demographics and service usage impact the churn rate?
